# project-etch-a-sketch

In this project, I have created a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. The main goal of this project is to flex my DOM manipulations skill.

# Users should be able to:

User should be able to create a grid of chosen size (min 16*16, max 100*100).
When mouse passes over the created grid, each cell change color, leaving a (pixelated) trail through the grid like a pen would.
User can chose different color to draw including multicolor option (color randomly changes on each cell).
User should be able to clear board whe Clear button pressed.
